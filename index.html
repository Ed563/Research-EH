<h2>Launching Microsoft 1.0</h2>
<p>In November of 1983, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/20/3671922/windows-1-0-microsoft-history-desktop-gracefully-failed">Microsoft</a> announced Windows! For a 99 dollar bundle it came with: a notepad, calendar, clock, cardfile, terminal application, file manager, a game of Reversi, Windows Write and Windows Paint. Windows was an attempt to have an operating desktop system that as affordable. It took two more years for Windows to be released. In November of 1985 the company shipped the operating system, and the next evening Microsoft decided to hold a session where they made fun of themselves. They lampooned about their missed released dates. They even tossed dry ice in a bucket to try to get genuine vapor. Windows 1 launched optimistic but middling reviews, but Microsoft didn’t end up making it as affordable as intended too. To be honest, in the 80s the entire PC industry was a wild jungle and thank goodness those days are not still here. Windows 1.0 was launched into a market about to boom. There were some competing brands/ platforms, but if windows had failed, there could have been a huge number of computers waiting for the next version of the now operating more familiar operating system. That is, unless you think PC will make its way for mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Development of Cell Phones</h2>
<p>Many of the early <a href="https://www.artinstitutes.edu/about/blog/the-history-and-evolution-of-cell-phones">cell phones</a> were extremely large and a task to carry around. In 1983, the Motorola dynatac 8000x arrived for the public. This was considered the first mobile cell phone because you could take it around places.  But at that time cell phones had not been spread to the general public. “They were primarily used in the sales and business world, but not often for personal use like you see today,”- Kreg Jones. Early telephones were just meant for talking, but gradually different features were added like voicemail. Eventaully manufacturers realized they could incorporate multi-media purposes into the phones. In recent years, The purpose shifted from a communicating tool to a tool with many purposes. Cell phones today have begun to replace many different gadgets like cameras etc. Cell phones have developed rapidly over the last decade. We can expect that the cell phone will completely take over the market, and there is no telling what the cell phone has in store for us.</p>

<h2> Development of the Company Apple</h2>
<p>The company apple is an essential part of the development of technology, most in part because millions of people have an <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/history-of-apple-steve-jobs-mac-3606104/influenced">Apple</a> device. It started in the garage of Job’s parent’s house in California. Jobs replaces Amelio as chief executive in July 1997. After replacing him, Job’s first major launch since his return is imac. The desktop computer comes in a range of colours and is the first major product to be  by Jony Ivy. The attention turns to the music industry as the ipod is introduced in 2001. In 2003, the itunes store follows this release of the ipod. Moments after changing its name from Apple computer to Apple Inc, Jobs reveals the companies first smart mobile device. After returning from medical treatment, he takes the stage again to announce a much anticipated ipad. Jobs started getting very sick and hands the job off to Tim Cook who still runs apple today. Apple is very successful and still expanding to this day.</p>

<h2>Releasing of Different Computers</h2>
<p>The history of <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/">computers</a> starts like this. Bell Laboratories scientist George Stibitz uses relays for a demonstration adder. In 1940, The complex number calculator is completed. Then, Konrad Zuse finishes the Z3 computer. The CSIRAC runs is first program. The ERA 1101 is introduced to the public. The Institute Advanced Study (IAS) computer is a multi-year research project that was released in 1952. The digital Equipment Corporation, DEC, is founded in 1957. In 1973, The Wang laboratories release the Wang 2200.Then the Xerox PARC Alto was introduced. In 1978, The Tandy Radio shack introduces the TRS-8o. In 1992, the powerbook series of laptops is introduced. Apple then ships the first newton. The RISC PC Is released. First camera phone introduced. The world’s fastest supercomputer is released. It is called the Earth simulator. The powermac G5 is released in 2003. First Apple phone is released in 2008. The MacBook Air is released. The development of computers evolved slowly starting in the mid 1900s. </p>

<h2>Attempts at Making Televion</h2>
<p>The development of <a href="https://ethw.org/Milestones:First_Public_Demonstration_of_Television,_1926">television</a> is very important in our history because we still watch TV today. Charles Jenkins, and Vladimir Zworykin, succeeded in varying degrees to make progress towards the goal of true television that he reached in 1926, their systems were either not capable of dynamic operation or were unable to produce greyscale images or were deficient in both respects. Charles Jenkins, and Vladimir Zworykin, succeeded in making progress towards the goal of real television that he reached in 1926, their systems were either incapable of dynamic operation (e.g. the fax machine) or were unable to produce greyscale images (e.g. the shadowgraph), or were deficient in both respects. There was still work to do because as you know, today we have color when we watch TV. But it all started with Charles Jenkins and Vladimir. They had failed attempts at the television, but they were part pf the reason we have TV today because of their major contributions.</p>
